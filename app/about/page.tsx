          I am a dynamic and dedicated Senior Developer with a solid foundation
          in modern web development technologies including React, SharePoint,
          and the MERN stack. After a purposeful career break, I am now bringing
          fresh insights and updated techniques to Frontend or FullStack roles.
          I also boast a robust background in SharePoint development, having
          leveraged JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SharePoint, and Power Platform
          (PowerApp and Power Automate) to create impactful solutions. I believe
          I can be an asset to organizations seeking versatile developers
          capable of adapting to the needs of the project and continuously
          evolving with the industry.
